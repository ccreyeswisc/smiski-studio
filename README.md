# Smiski Studio

## Overview

This simple web application allows users to customize their own smiski art, selecting from many different possible combinations between smiski poses, hats, and backgrounds. Users can also save their art
onto their own local devices for their own personal use (stickers, wallpapers, etc.)

This project is also dedicated to one of my closest friends, Jess ðŸª»

## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Backend: TBD (Python maybe?)
