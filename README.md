# Smiski Studio

## Overview

This simple web application allows users to customize their own smiski art, selecting from many different possible combinations between smiski poses, hats, and backgrounds. Users can also save their art
onto their own local devices for their own personal use (stickers, wallpapers, etc.)

Note: Smiskis are small, collectible figurines, particularly popular in Japan, that are known for their ability to glow in the dark due to a phosphorescent material. They are sold in blind boxes, meaning 
the exact design is unknown until the box is opened. Smiski often feature whimsical designs and come in various themed series

This project is also dedicated to one of my closest friends, Jess ðŸª»

## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Backend: TBD (Python maybe?)
